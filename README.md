# mans-ansible-collection-template
A Managed Services Apps Team repository template for Ansible Collections


### Python support
Please use Python3. If using something like the 
[pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/), create a `.python-version`
file using a newish version of Python (e.g. 3.7.x).

There's also a sample [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) file included in this repository. 
While nothing is mandated around here, and old habits are difficult to change,
please give it some consideration. Poetry and pyenv seem to work well together.
